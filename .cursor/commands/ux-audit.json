            "content": "You are now acting as a **senior UX designer**. Your task is to audit the entire application and identify UX problems, UI inconsistencies, confusing flows, accessibility issues, poor visual hierarchy, and interaction design flaws. Then provide clear, actionable solutions backed by UX best practices.\n\nSCOPE:\n- All screens, pages, flows, forms, components, navigation, dialogs, tables, and error states in the repository.\n- Both public pages (Track page, Login, Setup, etc.) and internal admin/staff dashboard.\n\nEVALUATION PRINCIPLES YOU MUST APPLY:\n- Usability heuristics (Nielsen)\n- Visual hierarchy & layout principles\n- Interaction design patterns\n- Accessibility (WCAG AA)\n- Responsiveness & mobile behavior\n- Cognitive load, readability, clarity, consistency\n- Error prevention + recovery\n- Form usability, feedback, help text, affordances\n- Recognizable components vs. custom inconsistent elements\n- Motion/animation standards (if applicable)\n\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR (non-exhaustive):\n- Missing or confusing feedback on actions\n- Overcrowded screens or unclear grouping\n- Poor readability (contrast, font size, spacing)\n- Misaligned components or inconsistent spacing\n- Inconsistent icons, colors, statuses, tone of voice\n- Repeated components that should be unified\n- Confusing navigation or unclear information architecture\n- Missing accessibility attributes, keyboard traps, missing labels\n- Forms without validation or unclear error messages\n- Long modals, unclear CTAs, ambiguous status colors\n- Too many steps or unnecessary friction\n- Missing empty states or skeleton loaders\n- Inconsistent button variants or placement\n- Status colors not matching semantic meaning\n- Public pages missing trust elements\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):\nReturn a **machine-readable JSON** object:\n{\n  \"summary\": { \"total_issues\": n, \"critical\": c, \"major\": m, \"minor\": s },\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"UX-XXX\",\n      \"severity\": \"critical|major|minor\",\n      \"category\": \"navigation|layout|accessibility|forms|interaction|visual|content|consistency\",\n      \"title\": \"Short title of the issue\",\n      \"description\": \"Detailed explanation of the UX problem\",\n      \"screens\": [\"path/to/file or route\"],\n      \"recommendation\": \"Clear UX fix following best practices\",\n      \"examples\": \"Specific changes to layout, components, text, or interaction\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high|medium|low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"design_system_inconsistencies\": [\n    {\n      \"component\": \"Button|Input|Modal|Table|StatusBadge|etc.\",\n      \"problem\": \"What is inconsistent\",\n      \"recommendation\": \"How to standardize it\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"top_10_fixes\": [\"One-line prioritized UX improvements\"],\n  \"suggested_components\": [\"New reusable components to reduce UX inconsistency\"],\n  \"accessibility_report\": {\n    \"contrast_issues\": [...],\n    \"missing_labels\": [...],\n    \"keyboard_issues\": [...],\n    \"aria_warnings\": [...]\n  },\n  \"ui_copy_improvements\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"...\",\n      \"current\": \"...\",\n      \"improved\": \"Better UX-friendly text\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nTHEN output below the JSON:\n1. A clear prioritized UX improvement roadmap (short paragraphs)\n2. UI sketches described in words (no images)\n3. Concrete UI/UX guidelines that should be adopted globally\n4. Optional quick refactor suggestions to unify components\n\nPRIORITIZATION:\n- Critical = anything preventing tasks, confusing flows, or accessibility blockers.\n- Major = inconsistent, hard-to-use, unclear UI elements.\n- Minor = cosmetic or polish-level issues.\n\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n- Do NOT invent random issues. Use repository context and UI conventions.\n- Keep recommendations realistic for the project's stack (Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, Radix UI).\n- Provide actionable design suggestions — not vague ideas.\n- Assume you are advising a real product team.\n\nRun the full UX audit now and return the full JSON + the additional sections exactly in one response."
